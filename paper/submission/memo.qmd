We follow R1's suggestion to compare DCPO with other methods, especially, @PetersonEtAl2022's Wcalc in more detail. 
In the main text (p. XXXX), we state the rationale to use DCPO over Wcalc in this research and direct readers to a special appendix, Appendix XXX.
In the new appendix, we discuss the methodological and operational differences between DCPO and Wcalc.
Furthermore, we compare the outcomes from the two methods and point out the advantage of DCPO on yielding more efficient estimation by incorporating information from other countries and scaling.
