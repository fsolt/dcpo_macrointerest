	abstract = {The publics of different societies are characterized by durable cultural orientations that have major political and economic consequences. Throughout the period from 1973 to 1987, given nationalities consistently showed relative high or low levels of a @'civic culture@'--a coherent syndrome of personal life satisfaction, political satisfaction, interpersonal trust and support for the existing social order. Those societies that rank high on this syndrome are much likelier to be stable democracies than those that rank low. Economic development and cultural change are linked in a complex pattern of reciprocal influence. Originally, Protestantism may have facilitated the rise of capitalism, leading to economic development, which in turn favored the emergence of the civic culture. But in those countries that attained high levels of prosperity, there eventually emerged postmaterialist values that tended to neutralize the emphasis on economic accumulation that earlier characterized Protestant societies.},

	abstract = {The widespread availability of large cross-national survey databases has encouraged researchers to test theories using public opinion data aggregated at the national level, but they have often done so without first demonstrating that the hypothesized relationships also exist at the individual level. Researchers can thus fall victim to a form of the ecological fallacy called the individualistic fallacy. An important example is Ronald Inglehart's discovery of a civic culture syndrome. This syndrome is tested with data from the Eurobarometer, World Values Survey, Latinobarometer, and surveys of the general public in Central America. The associations found between variables in this syndrome and democracy present a classic example of spuriousness. For the most part they are unrelated to support for democracy or democratic liberties.},

@article{Caughey2019,
	abstract = {Using new scaling methods and a comprehensive public opinion dataset, we develop the first survey-based time-series{\textendash}cross-sectional measures of policy ideology in European mass publics. Our dataset covers 27 countries and 36 years and contains nearly 2.7 million survey responses to 109 unique issue questions. Estimating an ordinal group-level IRT model in each of four issue domains, we obtain biennial estimates of the absolute economic conservatism, relative economic conservatism, social conservatism, and immigration conservatism of men and women in three age categories in each country. Aggregating the group-level estimates yields estimates of the average conservatism in national publics in each biennium between 1981{\textendash}82 and 2015{\textendash}16. The four measures exhibit contrasting cross-sectional cleavages and distinct temporal dynamics, illustrating the multidimensionality of mass ideology in Europe. Subjecting our measures to a series of validation tests, we show that the constructs they measure are distinct and substantively important and that they perform as well as or better than one-dimensional proxies for mass conservatism (left{\textendash}right self-placement and median voter scores). We foresee many uses for these scores by scholars of public opinion, electoral behavior, representation, and policy feedback.},

@article{Claassen2020,
	abstract = {It is widely believed that democracy requires public support to survive. The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is weak, however, with existing tests resting on small cross-sectional samples and producing contradictory results. The underlying problem is that survey measures of support for democracy are fragmented across time, space, and different survey questions. In response, this article uses a Bayesian latent variable model to estimate a smooth country-year panel of democratic support for 135 countries and up to 29 years. The article then demonstrates a positive effect of support on subsequent democratic change, while adjusting for the possible confounding effects of prior levels of democracy and unobservable time-invariant factors. Support is, moreover, more robustly linked with the endurance of democracy than its emergence in the first place. As Lipset (1959) and Easton (1965) hypothesized over 50 years ago, public support does indeed help democracy survive.},

A training set x\textsubscript{1}, x\textsubscript{2}, {$\cdots$}, x\textsubscript{n} of previous cases, along with their correct assignments, is known. These can be used to estimate Fisher's discriminant by maximum likelihood and then to assign x on the basis of the estimated discriminant, a method known as the normal discrimination procedure. Logistic regression does the same thing but with the estimation of Fisher's discriminant done conditionally on the observed values of x\textsubscript{1}, x\textsubscript{2}, {$\cdots$}, x\textsubscript{n}. This article computes the asymptotic relative efficiency of the two procedures. Typically, logistic regression is shown to be between one half and two thirds as effective as normal discrimination for statistically interesting values of the parameters.},

	abstract = {Do democratic regimes depend on public support to avoid backsliding? Does public support, in turn, respond thermostatically to changes in democracy? Two prominent recent studies (Claassen 2020a; 2020b) reinvigorated the classic hypothesis on the positive relationship between public support for democracy and regime survival{\textemdash}and challenged its reciprocal counterpart{\textemdash}by using a latent variable approach to measure mass democratic support from cross-national survey data. However, both studies used only the point estimates of democratic support. We show that incorporating the concomitant measurement uncertainty into these analyses reveals that there is no support for either study's conclusion. Efforts to minimize the uncertainty by incorporating additional survey data still fail to yield evidence in support of either hypothesis. These results underscore the need for both more nuanced analyses of the relationships between public support and democracy and taking measurement uncertainty into account when working with latent variables.},

Drawing on recent advances in latent-variable modeling of public opinion and a comprehensive collection of survey data, we present the Public Gender Egalitarianism dataset to address this need: comparable estimates of the public's attitudes on gender equality in the public sphere across more than one hundred countries over time. These Public Gender Egalitarianism scores are strongly correlated with responses to individual survey items and with women's rates of participation in the labor force and corporate boards. We expect that the Public Gender Egalitarianism data will become an invaluable source for broadly cross-national and longitudinal research on the causes and consequences of collective attitudes toward gender equality in politics and the economy.},
